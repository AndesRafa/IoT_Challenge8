1. **Coloured Petri Net**: Mathematical model used to analyze and model concurrent and distributed communication and computational systems.

1. **Hypertext-driven Navigation**: also called “hypermedia as the engine of application state”, is an iterative process in which a client uses representations (e.g. XML) to select identifications (e.g. URI), utilizes identifications to determine interactions with resources (e.g. HTTP), and follows the interactions to obtain representations and connections.
